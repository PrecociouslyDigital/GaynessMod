#LGBTQ+ Mod!

This is a mod that adds LGBTQ+ Representation to RimWorld. Works with 1.6.

Pawns now all fall somewhere on the Kinsey Scale. Their alignment is hidden and unknowable. The trait "Gay" should no longer exist (If it still pops up I'm sorry I still don't know how Traits work).

Working on adding Ace, Demi and Aro representation when I get around to it.

Will also work on adding Trans and nb representation when I figure out how to do it (if you have ideas message me!)
